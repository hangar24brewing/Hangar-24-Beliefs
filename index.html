      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To gather people around the table through the ancient gifts of beer,
        bread and celebration; creating space where hearts encounter the
        abundant life that transforms everything.

      <h2>The Heart of Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        At Hangar 24, a great business isn’t just about what we make—it’s about
        who we are, how we work and how we build each other up. Our core
        beliefs aren’t abstract ideals hanging on a wall; they are living
        principles that flow through every batch we brew, every plate we
        serve and every conversation we share. They shape our decisions
        when no one is watching and remind us who we truly are in the moments
        that define us.

    <section id="pillar1">
      <h2>Time‑Honored American Values</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Strong individuals build strong communities. Hangar 24 draws on a
        heritage of character that crossed oceans with pilgrims, cleared
        wilderness with pioneers and built a nation from an impossible dream.
        These seven foundational values create the bedrock upon which
        everything else is built.

          <summary><span>Truthful</span><small>Reality doesn’t negotiate—it simply is.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Reality doesn’t negotiate—it simply is. Living truthfully means having the courage to pursue what’s real, speak what’s accurate, and welcome what’s hard—because you genuinely care. Fear whispers that truth will cost you something, and fear is right. Truth demands its price—relationships strained, convenience sacrificed, easy paths abandoned. But fear offers information, not instruction. The easy path of silence and denial costs nothing in the moment yet harms everyone in the end. When right words become hard words, someone must speak with grace. That someone is you—not because courage feels natural, but because love leaves no choice. Truth builds the only foundation capable of bearing real weight, worth whatever sacrifice its construction demands.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer who immediately reports batch variations that others might overlook, understanding that hidden problems become visible disasters.</li>
            <li>The server who honestly admits when they don’t know something rather than guessing, because guests deserve accurate information.</li>
            <li>The sales representative who acknowledges product limitations upfront, building trust through transparency rather than losing it through discovery.</li>
            <li>The cook who calls out timing issues before they reach the guest, choosing momentary discomfort over lasting disappointment.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Loving</span><small>Love sees what is and chooses what could be.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Love sees what is and chooses what could be. It’s the decision to want someone else’s good even when they can’t give you anything in return. Love isn’t sentiment—it’s commitment. It doesn’t wait for worthiness; it creates it. When convenience conflicts with care, love chooses care. When personal gain conflicts with another’s good, love chooses good. This is the force that transforms everything it touches.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer who stays late to mentor a struggling colleague, investing personal time in another’s growth.</li>
            <li>The server who remembers a regular guest’s difficult period and checks in genuinely, not for tips but for humanity.</li>
            <li>The sales manager who advocates internally for a customer’s legitimate concern, even when it costs the company money.</li>
            <li>The cook who prepares a special accommodation for someone with dietary restrictions, treating their need as an opportunity to serve rather than an inconvenience to manage.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Servant‑Hearted</span><small>Strength finds its highest expression in service.</small></summary>
          <p>
            True power reveals itself through restraint. The person who can lead chooses to lift. The one who could demand instead decides to give. Service is not subservience—it’s strength choosing its highest expression. When you carry weight that isn’t yours to carry, you discover muscles you didn’t know you had. The strongest people we know are those who made others stronger by their presence.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The head brewer who handles the most tedious cleaning tasks alongside apprentices, demonstrating that no work is beneath those who truly lead.</li>
            <li>The experienced server who takes the difficult tables to protect newer staff while they build confidence.</li>
            <li>The senior sales rep who gives the best leads to developing team members, understanding that their success multiplies rather than threatens.</li>
            <li>The executive chef who preps vegetables when the kitchen is behind, serving the operation rather than protecting status.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Good</span><small>Goodness sees need and simply responds.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Goodness is simple and profound: wanting what’s best and acting on it. Good people don’t calculate kindness or manufacture virtue—
            they naturally lean toward what helps, what heals, what builds up. They see someone struggling and step in. They notice what’s broken and work to fix it. They recognize what’s harmful and refuse to participate. Goodness doesn’t keep score or demand recognition; it simply sees need and responds, sees potential and nurtures it, sees wrong and opposes it. It’s the quiet moral strength that makes communities safe, relationships trustworthy, and workplaces places where people can flourish. Good people make the world better by their presence.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer who notices equipment stress before failure occurs, preventing problems that would affect everyone.</li>
            <li>The server who intervenes when another employee faces an unreasonable customer, stepping in without being asked.</li>
            <li>The sales professional who warns a client against a purchase that wouldn’t serve them well, protecting relationship over revenue.</li>
            <li>The cook who takes initiative to help a food runner during a rush, seeing the need and responding naturally.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Faithful Stewards</span><small>Faithfulness is the compound interest of character.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Faithfulness is the compound interest of character. Small promises kept create large trust. When no one’s watching, when it’s inconvenient, when easier options present themselves—this is where faithfulness proves itself. We keep our word and honor what we’ve been entrusted with: our bodies, minds, families and work. We’re caretakers of gifts meant to serve beyond ourselves. Not in grand gestures but in the thousand small decisions that either build reliability or erode it. Your word becomes your bond only when tested by time and circumstance.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer who maintains rigorous sanitation protocols even during overtime pressure, stewarding both product integrity and team safety.</li>
            <li>The server who consistently follows up on promises made to guests, whether about special requests or return visits.</li>
            <li>The sales rep who manages territory relationships through market downturns, remaining present when others might disappear.</li>
            <li>The cook who cares for ingredients with the same attention whether preparing for VIPs or regular service, understanding that excellence has no casual setting.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Humble</span><small>Humility builds bridges where pride builds walls.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Humility is accurate self‑assessment. Not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less. It’s the wisdom to know what you don’t know and the strength to admit it. Pride builds walls; humility builds bridges. The moment you think you’ve mastered something, you stop learning from it. The moment you think you’re above someone, you stop learning from them. Humility keeps you teachable, which keeps you growing.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The master brewer who asks questions of the newest apprentice, recognizing that fresh perspectives reveal blind spots that experience can create.</li>
            <li>The veteran server who learns new techniques from younger colleagues, understanding that innovation doesn’t respect tenure.</li>
            <li>The successful sales director who credits team members in leadership meetings, ensuring recognition flows to those who generate results.</li>
            <li>The head chef who acknowledges mistakes publicly and adjusts recipes based on line cook feedback, modeling learning over ego protection.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Joyful</span><small>Joy is contagious rebellion against despair.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Joy cuts through darkness like nothing else can. It’s not the absence of difficulty but the presence of perspective. When life gets heavy, joy doesn’t deny the weight—it finds meaning in carrying it. Laughter becomes rebellion against despair. Celebration becomes defiance against cynicism. Joy is contagious in the best way, spreading hope to places that forgot what it looked like.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer who finds genuine satisfaction in the daily routine of transformation, seeing magic in the ancient dance of yeast and grain.</li>
            <li>The server who brings authentic warmth to interactions even during difficult shifts, understanding that their energy shapes others’ experiences.</li>
            <li>The sales professional who approaches challenging negotiations with genuine optimism, believing in solutions that serve everyone involved.</li>
            <li>The cook who takes visible pleasure in plating beautiful food, communicating through their craft that nourishment is worthy of celebration.</li>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Character holds when everything else gives way. These seven qualities weave together like strands in a rope—each one strengthening the others. Truth without love becomes harsh. Love without goodness becomes enabling. Goodness without humility becomes self‑righteousness. Remove any strand, and the whole fabric weakens. We hire for character and nurture its growth. Some arrive with deep roots; others come with hunger to grow. What matters is the direction someone faces and their willingness to be shaped alongside others who share the journey. Character becomes artistry when it meets skill, and both flourish in community. Character forms the foundation. Upon this bedrock, we build everything else—our craft, our community, our shared becoming. This is where Hangar 24 begins.

    <!-- Pillar 2: Masterful Craftsmanship -->
    <section id="pillar2">
      <h2>Masterful Craftsmanship</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Throughout history, the greatest craftsmen have understood that their
        work connects them to forces larger than themselves. Excellence
        emerges when skill becomes stewardship and craft becomes calling.
        These seven principles reveal why some work transcends function to
        become art and why craftsmanship is more than making things well—it’s
        creating things that matter.
      </p>
      <div class="accordion">
        <details>
          <summary><span>Partnership with Purpose</span><small>We are designed to create, built to build.</small></summary>
          <p>
            The finest craftsmen recognize they didn’t invent their abilities—
            they received them. Talent emerges from sources beyond personal effort,
            flows through hands that didn’t design themselves, works with minds that
            discovered rather than created the principles they follow. This understanding
            transforms arrogance into gratitude, performance into stewardship.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer who approaches fermentation knowing that yeast transformation follows laws he didn’t write, using processes he inherited from countless generations of beer‑makers.</li>
            <li>The server who understands that genuine hospitality draws from wells deeper than personality or training.</li>
            <li>The cook who respects ingredients as gifts from earth and seasons beyond human control.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><span>Reverence for Detail</span><small>Excellence lives in the margins others overlook.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Ancient master builders knew that invisible foundations determine visible beauty.
            A structure’s strength depends on precision applied where no one will ever look.
            This principle separates true craftsmen from mere performers—the willingness to invest
            care in details that matter precisely because others might ignore them.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Following protocols when unobserved because integrity doesn’t require an audience.</li>
            <li>Maintaining equipment with care that extends beyond immediate necessity.</li>
            <li>Measuring twice, checking constantly, refusing shortcuts that compromise quality for convenience.</li>
            <li>Understanding that details create the difference between good enough and genuinely great.</li>

          <summary><span>Sacred Stewardship</span><small>Everything entrusted to us demands faithful care.</small></summary>
          <p>
            Every resource—materials, time, opportunities, relationships—arrives as temporary trust. The barley represents months of agricultural labor. The guest’s evening represents irreplaceable time. The teammate’s development represents potential that, once wasted, cannot be recovered. Excellence emerges from treating temporary responsibilities as permanent accountabilities.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Using ingredients with consciousness of their true cost—not just financial but environmental, agricultural and human.</li>
            <li>Managing time as the non‑renewable resource it actually is.</li>
            <li>Treating tools and equipment as extensions of respect for those who created them and those who will use them after us.</li>

          <summary><span>Work as Expression</span><small>What we make reveals who we are.</small></summary>
          <p>
            The ancient masters understood something modern culture often forgets: work is not separate from identity but expression of it. Every brewing decision, every service interaction, every dish reflects the character of its creator. Quality becomes personal signature, mediocrity becomes self‑betrayal.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The brewer whose consistency reflects personal reliability.</li>
            <li>The server whose attention mirrors inner values about how people deserve to be treated.</li>

          <p>
            The path to excellence is paved with acknowledged ignorance. Every master was once a beginner; every expert still encounters mysteries. Pride builds walls around current knowledge; humility opens doors to deeper understanding. The wise seek instruction everywhere—from mentors, mistakes, observation, even from those they’re teaching.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The veteran who studies new techniques not from insecurity but from understanding that growth never ends.</li>
            <li>The experienced professional who learns from newcomers because fresh eyes often see what familiarity misses.</li>
            <li>The leader who asks questions that reveal gaps rather than hiding them.</li>

          <p>
            Time and process cannot be negotiated. Fermentation follows its own schedule. Relationships develop through consistency over seasons. Skills mature through repetition across years. Excellence emerges from respecting the natural rhythms that quality demands, refusing the modern temptation to hurry what requires patience.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Honoring fermentation schedules regardless of production pressure.</li>
            <li>Allowing team members developmental time instead of demanding immediate expertise.</li>
            <li>Building reputation through consistency over years rather than seeking shortcuts to recognition.</li>

          <p>
            Ultimate mastery reveals itself not in personal glory but in others’ flourishing. The greatest craftsmen create value that extends beyond themselves—employment for others, nourishment for community, beauty for a world that needs more of it. Skill without service becomes self‑indulgent display; service without skill becomes well‑intentioned mediocrity.
          </p>
          <h4>In Practice</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The master who develops systems enabling team success rather than showcasing individual brilliance.</li>
            <li>The senior professional who mentors others because greatness multiplies through generous teaching.</li>
            <li>The expert who creates work that strengthens community while expressing personal excellence.</li>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          When these principles guide Hangar 24’s pursuit of Masterful Craftsmanship,
          every brewing decision reflects deeper purpose, every service interaction carries greater meaning, and every perfectly prepared dish becomes an expression of values that outlast the meal itself. This understanding transforms workplace into workshop, job into calling, career into craft. It reveals why some businesses endure while others fade, why some work satisfies while other work depletes, why some craftsmanship inspires while other production merely functions. Excellence built on these foundations doesn’t just create better beer, food and service—it creates better people, stronger community and work that matters for reasons extending far beyond the workplace walls. This is craftsmanship as the ancients understood it: not just making things well, but making things that matter for purposes that last.

    <!-- Pillar 3: Transformational Community -->
    <section id="pillar3">
      <h2>Transformational Community</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Even the finest ingredients require the right environment to reach their potential. Hangar 24 isn't just about making great beer—it's about bringing people together. A strong community isn't just a group of people in the same place; it's a culture built on encouragement, accountability, and shared experiences. At Hangar 24, we foster a culture where people are sharpened, supported, and strengthened—where iron sharpens iron, and no one walks alone. Like the complex interplay of yeast, barley, hops, and time that creates something greater than its components, our community transforms individual efforts into collective achievement. We understand that true transformation happens not in isolation but in relationship. The ancient wisdom holds: we become like those we spend time with. Character spreads through proximity. Excellence transfers through example. Hope multiplies through witness. What we choose to cultivate in our shared spaces determines not just what we accomplish together, but who we become in the process. These five principles reveal how individual strength serves collective flourishing, how personal excellence becomes communal transformation. They show that the strongest organizations are not collections of remarkable individuals, but ordinary people made remarkable through the alchemy of authentic relationship.

          <summary><span>Foundation Principles</span><small>Character &amp; individuality</small></summary>
          <p>Building the bedrock of authentic relationship through love, honor, acceptance, and kindness. We recognize that transformational community begins with individuals of character who create space for others to flourish. Love sees worth beyond usefulness. Honor recognizes inherent value regardless of position. Acceptance embraces difference within shared fundamental values. Kindness chooses consideration over convenience, revealing strength through deliberate restraint.</p>
          <div class="sub-accordion">
            <details>
              <summary><span>Love One Another</span></summary>
              <p>Love builds the foundation upon which all authentic community stands. This isn't soft sentiment but rugged commitment—placing others' well-being above personal advantage. In a world reducing people to their usefulness, love recognizes the inherent worth in each person and acts accordingly. (John 13:34-35)</p>

                <li><strong>Brewery — Production:</strong> A master brewer notices a team member struggling with personal challenges affecting work performance.

          <p>Governing how we respond to both struggle and success, recognizing that true belonging emerges especially in how we handle vulnerability, need, and achievement. The strongest among us lift others' burdens without fanfare. We serve one another, demonstrating that true leadership reveals itself through consistent action that elevates the entire team. We submit when another's expertise should take precedence, acknowledging limitations with confidence. We carry burdens too heavy for one person to bear alone. We stand with one another in hardship, offering presence without rushing to end discomfort. We celebrate achievements deliberately, creating moments that strengthen bonds beyond transactional relationships. We create welcome that forges belonging, not merely temporary acceptance.</p>

              <p>The strongest among us are those who lift others' burdens without fanfare. True leadership reveals itself not through authority but through consistent action that elevates the entire team. Service transforms hierarchy from systems of control into frameworks for collective achievement, where title matters less than tangible contribution. (Galatians 5:13)</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Brewery — Production:</strong> The production manager, despite his title, joins the cleaning crew during deadline pressure, demonstrating that essential work transcends status.</li>
                <li><strong>Brewery — Sales:</strong> A top-performing representative volunteers to handle administrative paperwork during a colleague's absence, focusing on team results above role limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant — Servers:</strong> A server who has completed his sidework stays an extra thirty minutes to help a newer colleague with closing procedures, prioritizing team success over personal convenience.</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant — Cooks:</strong> The executive chef notices the dish pit overwhelmed during a sudden rush and wordlessly steps in to clear the backup, demonstrating that hierarchy serves function, not ego.</li>

              <summary><span>Submit to One Another</span></summary>
              <p>Real strength acknowledges when another's expertise should take precedence. Submission recognizes when someone else's knowledge, perspective, or experience offers the better path—regardless of title or position. It requires the confidence to acknowledge limitations and the wisdom to leverage capabilities beyond our own. (Ephesians 5:21)</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Brewery — Production:</strong> A senior brewer adopts a junior colleague's recommendation on a technical process improvement, recognizing specialized knowledge that transcends general experience.</li>

              <p>No one should stand alone beneath weight too heavy to bear. We recognize when someone's load exceeds their capacity and step in—not to take over but to share the weight until they regain strength. This requires awareness of others' circumstances and willingness to temporarily increase our own load to decrease theirs. (Galatians 6:2, Ecclesiastes 4:9-10)</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Brewery — Production:</strong> When a brewer's parent requires emergency care, colleagues automatically absorb his responsibilities without requiring detailed explanation or creating future obligation.</li>

              <summary><span>Stand With One Another in Hardship</span></summary>
              <p>When words fail, presence speaks. In times of loss, authentic support offers the discipline of being present without minimizing, spiritualizing, or prematurely resolving pain. The commitment to stand alongside someone in darkness—bearing witness without rushing to end discomfort—creates space for genuine restoration. (Romans 12:15, Job 2:13)</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Brewery — Production:</strong> When a long-tenured brewer loses a family member, colleagues cover responsibilities while avoiding empty platitudes, instead offering specific practical support and steady presence.</li>
                <li><strong>Brewery — Sales:</strong> After a representative loses a major account despite diligent work, the team acknowledges the genuine disappointment before moving to analysis, allowing appropriate processing alongside professional development.</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant — Servers:</strong> When a server experiences significant personal setback, colleagues offer shifts of lighter emotional demand while providing space for authentic expression rather than forced positivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant — Cooks:</strong> Following a cook's personal crisis, kitchen staff demonstrate solidarity through straightforward consideration during shifts, recognizing that acknowledgment without intrusion honors both the struggle and privacy.</li>

Deliberate celebration marks achievements both personal and professional, creating moments that strengthen bonds beyond transactional relationships. By specifically acknowledging effort and accomplishment, we establish memories that sustain during challenging periods and reinforce our foundational standards. (Romans 12:15, Ecclesiastes 3:4)</p>

              <p>True hospitality forges belonging, not merely temporary acceptance. Beyond surface courtesy, it creates environments where people feel valued for who they are, not just what they produce. This welcome extends beyond physical spaces to creating emotional environments where authenticity flourishes and pretense becomes unnecessary. (1 Peter 4:9, Hebrews 13:2)</p>
              <ul>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>We are meant to live, work, and grow together. A culture of strong, committed individuals (Time-Honored American Values) combined with a relentless pursuit of excellence (Masterful Craftsmanship) creates an unshakable community (Transformational Community). When these five principles guide our daily interactions, something remarkable happens. The workplace transforms from a collection of individual performances into a symphony of collaborative excellence. Ordinary moments— the daily greeting, the shared meal break, the difficult conversation, the celebrated success—become the building blocks of something larger than any one person could create. This understanding reveals why some businesses endure while others fade, why some work satisfies while other work depletes, why some teams inspire while others merely function. Community built on these foundations doesn’t just create better beer, food, and service—it creates better people. The strength flows both ways. Individual character creates the possibility for authentic community, while genuine community shapes and strengthens individual character. Like the ancient process of fermentation itself, transformation requires both the right ingredients and the right environment. Neither alone is sufficient; together they become extraordinary. This is how ordinary people accomplish extraordinary things: not through superhuman effort, but through the multiplication that happens when character meets craft within authentic community. This is transformational community as the ancients understood it—not just working together, but becoming more together than any could become alone. This is where Hangar 24’s true strength lies.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>The Complete Brew</h2>
      <p>
        These three core beliefs—<strong>Time‑Honored American Values</strong>, <strong>Masterful Craftsmanship</strong> and <strong>Transformational Community</strong>—work together like essential ingredients in a perfect brew. Each is powerful alone, but together they create something greater than the sum of their parts. Like a great beer that begins with the character of its ingredients, continues through the disciplined craft of brewing, and finds its highest purpose when shared in community, Hangar 24 creates experiences that matter:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time‑Honored American Values →</strong> Defines <em>WHO WE ARE</em> (personal character, integrity, responsibility).</li>
        <li><strong>Masterful Craftsmanship →</strong> Defines <em>HOW WE WORK</em> (work ethic, discipline and excellence in your craft).</li>
        <li><strong>Transformational Community →</strong> Defines <em>HOW WE INTERACT</em> (sharpening, uplifting and challenging one another to grow).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn’t just corporate culture. This is Hangar 24’s way of life.
